Visualization: https://trobinson11.github.io/Data-Visualization/

Overview:
This is a visualization of United States GDP by state from 1963 to 2017. The data was obtained from BEA.gov. 
The application works by clicking on the states whose data you wish to see and viewing the data 
on the graph. Other features include a slider to zoom to any particular time interval, as well
as a button for selecting all states, a button for just selecting the national average, and a button
for reseting the visualization application.
