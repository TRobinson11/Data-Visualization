# Project 1: Visualizing time series data


#### Visualization: https://trobinson11.github.io/Data-Visualization/

#### Overview:

This is a visualization of United States GDP by state from 1963 to 2017. The data was obtained from BEA.gov. 
The application works by clicking on the states whose data you wish to see and viewing the data 
on the graph. Other features include a slider to zoom to any particular time interval, as well
as a button for selecting all states, a button for just selecting the National Average, and a button
for reseting the visualization application. 


#### Data Formating: 
  1. The csv file was initialy horizontally configured, so Excel was used to reconfigure the data into a 
     vertical format.
  
  2. The data also did not initially include the National Average, just the National Rate, so Excel was used
     to find the average of each year and the National Average values were created from this.
     

#### Notable Findings:

 ##### 1. GDP slope from 1990 - 2000:
      The GDP increases more from 1990 to 2000, this is due to an extended period of economic prosperity that
      occured after the end of the 1990s recession and ended during the 2000s recession.
      
 ##### 2. GDP drop from 2008 - 2012:
      There is a large drop in state and overal GDP from 2008 to 2012, this is due to the recent recession
      however, some over the states weren't as effected as others. For instance, New York and many of the smaller
      states were almost unaffected, while states such as Texas and California were heavily affected.
